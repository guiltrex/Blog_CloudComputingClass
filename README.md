#Solution idea to Problem 3 of HW2 (AuthEdit Branch)

This Rails project shows a rough idea to the 3rd problem of HW2 in Cloud Computing Class at University of New Mexico. Students are required to create a basic blog where only blog creator can delete and edit the blog. Since these files are created to help students kick off the problem, there's still more work that need be done before submittal.

This solution requires the user to input the name of blog creator, which aims to satisfy the requirement of the problem (i.e. only blog creator can edit and delete the blog). However, this solution only fulfills the restricted 'edit' part. The 'delete' part is left for you to finish. :)

Another solution idea is to create an authentication system which is included in master branch of the same repo.

Feel free to download and modify the files if you think they are helpful.
