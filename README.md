#Solution idea to Problem 2 of HW2

These files show a rough idea to the 2nd problem of HW2 in Cloud Computing Class at University of New Mexico. Students are required to use Active Record to interact with a database and do some basic database operations.

Since these files are created to help students kick off the problem, there's still more work that need be done before submittal.

Feel free to download and modify the files if you think they are helpful.
