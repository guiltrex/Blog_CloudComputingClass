#Solution idea to Problem 3 of HW2

This Rails project shows a rough idea to the 3rd problem of HW2 in Cloud Computing Class at University of New Mexico. Students are required to create a basic blog where only blog creator can delete and edit the blog. Since these files are created to help students kick off the problem, there's still more work that need be done before submittal.

This solution uses an authentication system to ensure restricted access and manipulation to the blog, which is based on http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised.

Feel free to download and modify the files if you think they are helpful.
